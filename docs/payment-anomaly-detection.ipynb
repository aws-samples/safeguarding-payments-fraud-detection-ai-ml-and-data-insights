    "This Jupyter Notebook describes the AI/ML techniques and algorithms used to detect potential anomalies and surface fraud signals. The python code below walks you through the logic behind transforming payments into vectors. The historical payments with or without fraud signals are stored as vectors in PostgreSQL database pre-installed with pgvector extension.\n",
